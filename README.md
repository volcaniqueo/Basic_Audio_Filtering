# Basic_Audio_Filtering
This project was my 3rd Homework for the course CMPE 362 (Introduction to Signal Processing for Computer Engineers) at Bogazici University. This project uses MATLAB environment for a basic implementation of audio filtering.

## Details
This project uses FIR (fir1 function in MATLAB) filtering method for given threshold frequencies in the project description.

## To Run the Code
The code can be easily run with MATLAB application. Make sure you have the audio and the code in the same directory.
